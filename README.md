# Big_Mart_Sales_Forecast
An end-to-end ML project to forecast the BigMart store sales

# Problem Statement
Nowadays, shopping malls and Big Marts keep track of individual item sales data in order to forecast future client demand and adjust inventory management. In a data warehouse, these data stores hold a significant amount of consumer information and particular item details. By mining the data store from the data warehouse, more anomalies and common patterns can be discovered. The main goal is to make analysis of data and to build Machine learning model to predict the sales of each the item at a particular outlet. We have 12 columns and 8523 rows of data. We get this data from Kaggle.
